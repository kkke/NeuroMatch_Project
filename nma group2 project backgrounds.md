## Project group 2 backgrounds and expectations
Everyone can enter a short summary of their backgrounds and expectations here. These are grouped alphabetically by last name.

#### Ke Chen:
_Background_: System neuroscience, Cognitive Neuroscience, Neural data (spiking data) Analysis, Classification, PCA, ..

_Expectation_: Apply  DL to analyze neural data

#### Julian Grande:
_Background_: Hello! I am finishing my degree in Systems Engineering and my thesis is on Segmentation of medical images from the IVUS-IBIS4 study where I implemented the U-NET and U-NET++ architectures. This is really all my experience in the Machine Learning area. I am currently working with Python version 3 and Tensorflow version 2.12

_Expectations_: Learn a little more about how to work with machine learning in general and get into the subject.

#### Mohammad Samavat, PhD:
_Background_: Electrical Engineering, Computational Neuroscience, Learning and memory.

_Expectations_: Applying/training/exploring Deep Learning to neuroscience data. 

#### Raymond Shpeley
_Background_: Industrial and process control, Computing Science, Python, PyTorch, Numpy, Scipy, and other related programming. Machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, NMA computational neuroscience courses and other tools. 

_Expectation_: To learn more about computational neuroscience methods. I’m happy to learn any area.

#### Dev Subramanian
_Background_: Systems neuroscience, Learning and memory, Electrophysiology (Ephys), Computational neuroscience (Basic ML/DL stuff)

_Expectation_: Understanding the working of DL models and what aspects of neuroscience can it be potentially applied to 

#### Arjun Verma
_Background_: Computer Science, ML/DL, Briefly explored automated speaker recognition systems, Affective Computing, Predominantly NLP

_Expectations_: I like drawing parallels between modern NLP architectures (dominantly LLMs) and the human brain. I’d be happy to explore something along similar directions or just preliminary explore computational neuroscience.
